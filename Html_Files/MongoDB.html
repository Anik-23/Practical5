        MongoDB Atlas, and extensions for search, data lakes, and mobile app development of MongoDB Cloud, factors out many problems that shut down growth and/or wrecks the customer experience. Downtime goes close to zero and features like Performance Adviser make tuning automatic.
        In the document model of MongoDB Atlas, data becomes like code in the form of JSON documents. Developers, not DBAs, shape the data and easily map it to application objects, accelerating time to market. Learn for yourself at MongoDB University. Then make it happen!
